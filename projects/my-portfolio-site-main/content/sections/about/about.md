<h1>Hi, i'm Jacob.</h1>

<h4>What I hope to do</h4>
<p>As a full-stack engineer, it is my goal to make a positive impact on software and products that enhance and empower people's lives. I really think that by creating tools that give communities more power, we can improve the world through code. Yes, let's change the world together!</p>

<h4>When I'm not coding</h4>
On my blog, I publish blog posts. These articles cover a wide range of backend subjects, such as software engineering, Python, and Django. I enjoy using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS to create applications and user interfaces.

<h4>What I'm doing</h4>
I am helping others as I advance in my career by sharing my experiences and perspectives through writing.

On my free time, I attend meetups, listen to engineering podcasts, read tech blogs, and take online courses to help me become a better developer for the people around me.
